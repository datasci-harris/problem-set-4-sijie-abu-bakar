**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 :Sijie Wu, sijiewu
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers. 

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

1.  
`PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD` for provider subtype code;
`PRVDR_CTGRY_CD` for provider type code;
`PRVDR_NUM` for CMS Certification Number;
`PGM_TRMNTN_CD` for Termination Code;
`ZIP_CD` for zip code;
`TRMNTN_EXPRTN_DT` for Termination Date;
`FAC_NAME` for facility name.

2.  

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
filepath1 = "pos2016.csv"
pos2016 = pd.read_csv(filepath1)
pos2016.head()
pos2016["year"] = 2016
pos2016_short = pos2016[(pos2016["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1) & (pos2016["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1)]
```


```{python}
# pos2016_short.shape
# print(f"Number of facility records: {pos2016_short.shape[0]}")

unique_count1 = pos2016_short['FAC_NAME'].nunique()
unique_count2 = pos2016_short['PRVDR_NUM'].nunique()
print(f"Number of unique PRVDR_NUM values: {unique_count2}")
print(f"Number of unique FAC_NAME values: {unique_count1}")

```


    a. I use `FAC_NAME` and `PRVDR_NUM` respectively to calculate the unique value of the short-term hospitals. Under CMS Certification Number, there are 7245 unique hospitals in Q4 2016 data set. Under facility name, there are 6770 unique hospitals in Q4 2016 data set. I believe this number is a bit large for short-term hospitals in Q4 2016.

    b. I searched for number of hospitals in 2020 to 2024 on [this website] (https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals), and discovers that the total number of hospitals in the United States is a little bit more than 6000, with 6039 in 2022 and 6120 in 2024. Also, [Kaiser Family Foundation] (https://www.kff.org/report-section/a-look-at-rural-hospital-closures-and-implications-for-access-to-care-three-case-studies-issue-brief/) states that, there are nearly 5000 short-term hospitals in the US.

    I believe the reason behind the difference is that, some hospitals change names over the time, and even though using the unique value of `facility name`, the hospitals are still not unique.

3.  

```{python}
filepath2 = "pos2017.csv"
pos2017 = pd.read_csv(filepath2)
pos2017["year"] = 2017
pos2017_short = pos2017[(pos2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1) & (pos2017["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1)]


filepath3 = "pos2018.csv"
pos2018 = pd.read_csv(filepath3, encoding='ISO-8859-1')
pos2018["year"] = 2018
pos2018_short = pos2018[(pos2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1) & (pos2018["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1)]

filepath4 = "pos2019.csv"
pos2019 = pd.read_csv(filepath4, encoding='ISO-8859-1')
pos2019["year"] = 2019
pos2019_short = pos2019[(pos2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1) & (pos2019["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1)]
```

```{python}
print(pos2017.head())
print(pos2018.head())
print(pos2019.head())
```

```{python}
pos_merge = pd.concat([pos2016_short, pos2017_short, pos2018_short, pos2019_short], ignore_index=True)
pos_merge.shape
pos_merge.to_csv("pos_merge.csv", index = False)
```


The plot of number of observations by year is as followed.

```{python}
import altair as alt

year_count = pos_merge["year"].value_counts().reset_index()
year_count.columns = ["year", "count"]

alt.Chart(year_count).mark_bar().encode(
    x = alt.X("count:Q", title = "Number of Observations"),
    y = alt.Y("year:N", title = "year")
).properties(
    title = "Number of Observations by Year"
)
```


4. 
    a.

```{python}
year_count_unique = pos_merge.groupby(
    "year")["PRVDR_NUM"].nunique().reset_index()
year_count_unique.columns = ["year", "count"]

alt.Chart(year_count_unique).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X("count:Q", title="Number of Hospitals"),
    y=alt.Y("year:N", title="year")
).properties(
    title="Number of Unique Hospitals by Year"
)
```


    b.
These two plots are the same. It means that the CMS certification number corresponds uniquely with the observations of hospitals.
